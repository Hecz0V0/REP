      <p>Project E was a Cold War arrangement under which the United States provided the United Kingdom with nuclear weapons for the Royal Air Force (RAF). It was later expanded to provide warheads to the British Army,
        and there was a maritime version known as "Project N" that provided nuclear depth bombs.<br/> US personnel retained custody of the weapons, and handled their storage, maintenance and readiness. The first bombers equipped
       with Project E weapons were Canberras (example pictured)to the operational restrictions, and the loss of independence of the British nuclear deterrent, Project E bombs were phased out in the strategic role in 1962 although 
       they still equipped tactical bombers, and were used on the Thor missiles operated by the RAF from 1959 to 1963<br/> under Project Emily. The British Army acquired Project E warheads for its Corporal, Honest John and Lance missiles,
        and its artillery pieces.<br/>The last Project E weapons were withdrawn from service in 1992.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War">(Full Article)</a></p>>
